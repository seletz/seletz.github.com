I’m currently in the process of unifying the documentation of **nexiles
gateway** – this is part of the ongoing effort to get marketing for nexiles
gateway started.

Why is documentation so important when we talk _marketing_? Does it not suffice
to have a nice and shiny landing page featuring a big “buy” button?

I believe it’s all about the target audience and the market, and the type of
customers.  For nexiles gateway, who are the possible customers?  I think that
these are mainly technical persons. Developers, Administatrors, Dev-Op people.

Those people need to _understand_ and _evaluate_ any new tool they want to use.
For them, the shiny landing page is a jump size to more detailed documentation.
Most technical people gauge the quality of a solution by the quality of the
documentation.

Writing good technical documentation is a huge effort – often this is a separate
position called _Technical Writer_ or similar. Luckily, there are good examples,
tools and guidelines.

One of the guidelines is [Diátaxis](https://diataxis.fr/ "https://diataxis.fr"):

> Diátaxis is an approach to [quality](https://diataxis.fr/quality/
> "https://diataxis.fr/quality/") in technical documentation. It describes an
> information architecture that emerges from a systematic approach to
> understanding the needs of documentation users.
> 
> Diátaxis identifies four modes of documentation - **tutorials**, **how-to
> guides**, **technical reference** and **explanation**. It derives its
> structure from the relationship between them.
> 
> In Diátaxis, each of these modes (or types) corresponds to a different user
> need. Each fulfils a different purpose and requires a different approach to
> its creation.

And JetBrains recently published a EAP of
[WriterSide](https://www.jetbrains.com/writerside/
"https://www.jetbrains.com/writerside/") – a IDE for Technical Writers, which
_also_ can be used as a plug-in for other IntelliJ IDE. it appears that they
follow the style of _diatraxis_.

Some initial experiments look promising -- we'll see how it goes.
