I just came back from a quite difficult afternoon business meeting
just to learn via [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38858012)
that one of my great heroes [Niklaus Wirth](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niklaus_Wirth)
died today[^footnote].

As a teenager, I invested all my time (lots of it) and money into all things
around computers.  I owned a VIC 20, then a C64, and then a Amiga 500.
I believe it was when I owned the Amiga when I stumbled on some weird Article
about the [Oberon](https://oberon.org/de) programming language and OS.  I lived
in a very rural town, dial-up networking was unreachable for me.  I lived of
things I got hold by "swapping" software and shareware.  That article mentioned
that you could mail-order the Oberon System for free from the ETH Zurich, which
I did.  One day -- I believe months later -- I got two 3 1/2" discs mailed.  I
tried it, did not understand, dumped it.  I believe I still have the disks.

Later, on the PC, I used Turbo Pascal to
[program](https://github.com/seletz/SomeOldShit), mostly computer graphics and
short programs where I tried to implement ideas from the _Computer Kurzweil_
series of the German _Spektrum der Wissenschaft_, originally a series of the
_Scientific American_.  Never again in my life I was so fluent and felt so
_connected_ to the machine using an IDE.  I still have the discs and printed
documentation of Turbo Pascal 7.0.

Later I would get to study computer science -- I wanted to study at the ETH
Zurich, but we couldn't afford it.  I ended up studying in Germany, which was
fine, too.

Since that time I always fantasied about visiting the ETH Zurich and actually
meet Niklaus Wirth.

Well, now the only thing I will be able to meet is his ideas.

RIP Niklaus Wirth.

             the original post above intact.
