We're probably doing stories wrong. We pack technical tasks into stories and
treat them like user stories. User stories should be **user centric**, capturing
a feature we want to bake into our product / solution.

This is a problem, because when we track many things in the sprint which do not
have direct customer value, we lead ourself to believe that there's progress in
the sprint, but there's none.

The sprint goal is always only to provide value to the customer. So while we are
busy finishing those technical stories, we trick ourself to believe that the
sprint is going all-right.

Another, deeper problem might be that we essentially treat our technical stories
equal to the customer stories. Technical stories more often than not do *not*
generate value. So we loose focus in the sprint. The focus should always be the
**customer value**.
