<!-- Welcome to my personal blog where I'll regularly share my thoughts and experiences -->
<!-- on subjects that fascinate me. -->

As a professional software developer and the founder and CTO of [nexiles] [1], a
dynamic software development and consulting firm, I've devoted my career to
technology and innovation.

----

In my position at nexiles, my responsibilities span research & development,
mentoring a talented group of software developers, and providing them with
ongoing support. I also play an active role in enhancing the features of
nexiles' primary products.

My current interests are centered on exploring loosely-coupled systems, delving
into event-driven design, and tackling challenges in integration and data
migration. 

At nexiles, I've positioned myself as a pioneer. I have initiated all of the
core products that the company proudly offers today. For several of these
innovations, I continue to be the principal contributor and driving force.

My journey with computers began at an early age. I started with a [VIC 20] [2],
transitioned through [C64] [3], [Amiga 500] [4], [Amiga 2000] [5], and
eventually to PCs. 

During my applied computer science studies, I embraced Linux and completed my
diploma thesis at a Frankfurt-based company specializing in banking transaction
software for UNIX systems. This experience introduced me to the `vi` editor (not
*vim*) and the world of terminal-based computing, which has influenced my
preference for modal editing. Now, I primarily use EMACS, augmented with
EVIL, and whenever I explore a new IDE, my first task is finding a vim mode or
plugin.

My professional career began by developing add-ons for a [3D CAD] [7] system in
[C] [6], compatible across various platforms including [Solaris] [8], [HP UX]
[9], [AIX] [10], [Linux] [11], [SGI/Irix] [12], and [Windows/NT] [13]. The
challenge of maintaining a singular codebase across these systems was immense.

I then delved into Linux kernel development for the [ARM] [14] architecture,
starting with the [StrongARM] [15] SOC and later the [XScale] [16]. My role
spanned from board bring-up and hardware debugging to creating custom drivers
and development libraries for high-speed measurement hardware. This period
involved intense problem-solving, real-time driver creation, and adapting older,
static memory layout codes to new platforms. It was a period of tremendous
growth and learning.

Concurrently, I co-founded [InQuant] [19] and later [nexiles] [1]. My time at
*InQuant* was marked by a shift to full-time web development, focusing on [Zope]
[20] and [Plone] [21] systems. It was here that I discovered my love for
[Python] [22]. Our projects included developing and hosting back-end systems for
Warner Music Germany's artist pages. This era also introduced me to the
principles of Test Driven Development.

At nexiles, I leveraged advanced programming languages and was actively
involved in UI development with tools like [coffeescript] [23] and [backbone.js]
[24] in the corporate world.

I've come full circle, developing back-end add-ons for a [PLM System] [25]
managing CAD data. Yet, I haven't forgotten my roots. I've been using [Jython]
[26] to streamline Java/Tomcat/Apache/Oracle complexities and am creating a
lean, efficient JSON web API to enhance functionality.

### Management Skills

TODO

### Tech Stack

- Nowadays I've embraced the Java ecosystem for it's stability.  I've been using
[Spring](https://spring.io) to develop several solutions and products.
- As a data persistence layer I've been using [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org).
- For messaging and enterprise integration, I've become quite fond of [RabbitMQ](https://rabbitmq.com)
- For UI, I've initially introduced the use of
[ExtJS](https://www.sencha.com/products/extjs), which has now been replaced by
[VueJS](https://vuejs.org).
- I'm used to do automated builds and deployments using various systems.
  Nowadays I use [GitHub actions](https://github.com/features/actions).
- I've been hosting servers both on premises and in the cloud.  Nowadays we use
  Kubernetes on the [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine)
- I'm fluent in [Python](http://www.python.org).
- I've been using several version control systems.  Currently I use
  [git](https://git-scm.com) since the Linux kernel development team moved to
  git from [bitkeeper](http://www.bitkeeper.org).
